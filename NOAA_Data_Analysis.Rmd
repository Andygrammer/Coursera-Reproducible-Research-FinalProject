## 1. Synopsis
This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

The main objective of this project is to answer the following questions using the NOAA storm database:

1. Which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Which types of events have the greatest economic consequences across the United States?

It was selected the following incidents to analysis and to answer these questions: fatalities and injuries (in the case of population health), and property and crop damage (in the case of economic consequences).

The analysis discovered that tornados are the most harmful event across the United States with respect to population health. Floods leads to the greatest economic consequences to properties, and droughts leads to the greatest economic consequences to crops.

## 2. Data Processing
Steps to load dataset into R (it did not any preprocessing outside this document):

1. Download dataset;
2. Unzip the csv file representing dataset;
3. Read the csv file;
4. Note the first lines of csv file;
5. Get the names of required health and economic analysis data;
6. Analysis of the data types;
7. Preprocessing: treat PROPDMGEXP values (PROPDMG = PROPDMG * PROPDMGEXP_preprocessed);
8. Preprocessing: treat CROPDMGEXP values (CROPDMG = CROPDMG * CROPDMGEXP_preprocessed).

Steps 3 and 4
```{r cache = TRUE}
data <- read.csv("../repdata_data_StormData.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE)
head(data)
```
Steps 5 and 6
```{r cache = TRUE}
names(data)
data_required <- c("EVTYPE", "FATALITIES", "INJURIES", "PROPDMG", "PROPDMGEXP", "CROPDMG", "CROPDMGEXP")
data <- data[data_required]
head(data)
```

```{r}
#unique(data$EVTYPE)
#unique(data$FATALITIES)
#unique(data$INJURIES)
#unique(data$PROPDMG)
unique(data$PROPDMGEXP)
```

Step 7 (records like "+", "-", "?" were treated as 0)
```{r message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
data <- data %>%
        mutate(PROPDMG = PROPDMG * case_when(
                PROPDMGEXP == "H" ~ 1e+02,
                PROPDMGEXP == "h" ~ 1e+02,
                PROPDMGEXP == "K" ~ 1e+03,
                PROPDMGEXP == "M" ~ 1e+06,
                PROPDMGEXP == "m" ~ 1e+06,
                PROPDMGEXP == "B" ~ 1e+09,
                PROPDMGEXP == "0" ~ 1,
                PROPDMGEXP == "1" ~ 10,
                PROPDMGEXP == "2" ~ 1e+02,
                PROPDMGEXP == "3" ~ 1e+03,
                PROPDMGEXP == "4" ~ 1e+04,
                PROPDMGEXP == "5" ~ 1e+05,
                PROPDMGEXP == "6" ~ 1e+06,
                PROPDMGEXP == "7" ~ 1e+07,
                PROPDMGEXP == "8" ~ 1e+08,
                PROPDMGEXP == "" ~ 1,
                PROPDMGEXP == "+" ~ 0,
                PROPDMGEXP == "-" ~ 0,
                PROPDMGEXP == "?" ~ 0
        ), PROPDMGEXP=NULL
        )
```

Step 6, again (other columns)
```{r}
#unique(data$CROPDMG)
unique(data$CROPDMGEXP)
```

Step 8 (records like "+", "-", "?" were treated as 0)
```{r}
data <- data %>%
        mutate(CROPDMG = CROPDMG * case_when(
                CROPDMGEXP == "K" ~ 1e+03,
                CROPDMGEXP == "k" ~ 1e+03,
                CROPDMGEXP == "M" ~ 1e+06,
                CROPDMGEXP == "m" ~ 1e+06,
                CROPDMGEXP == "B" ~ 1e+09,
                CROPDMGEXP == 0 ~ 1,
                CROPDMGEXP == 2 ~ 1e+02,
                CROPDMGEXP == "" ~ 1,
                CROPDMGEXP == "?" ~ 0
        ), CROPDMGEXP=NULL
        )
```

## 3. Data Analysis

1. Population health events: fatalities and injuries top 10;
2. Plot top 10 health issues;
3. Economic problem events: property and crop damages top 10;
4. Plot top 10 economic issues.
